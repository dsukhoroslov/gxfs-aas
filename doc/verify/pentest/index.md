## Penetration Test Results

The test was performed by T-Systems Multimedia Solutions team, found vulnerabilities are:

| Vulnerability                                          | Description/Resolution                                      |
|--------------------------------------------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------|
| Spring Boot Actuator endpoints available               | All Actuator endpoins exposed in `test` profile, and only few of them exposed in `prod` profile. As pentests were done on service started with `test` profile, the test was able to get access to some critical service data (tread/memory dump, etc.). This data is not available when service started with `prod` profile.                   |
| Access Control - Missing or Incorrect Authentication   | When service started with `test` profile SSI authentication performed with mocked TSA component which allows successful authentication to any user who request it. With `prod` profile service will use external TSA component which performs real SSI authentication using GAIA-X PCM and OCM services.                                        |
| Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information        | TLS certificates were not configured on the service endpoints yet  |
